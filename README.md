Multi-handle range slider widget for PyQt/PySide

The goal of this package is to provide a QRangeSlider that feels as "native"
as possible.  Styles should match the OS by default, and the slider should
behave like a standard QSlider... just with multiple handles.

- Attempts to match QSlider API as closely as possible
- Uses platform-specific Qt styles
- Supports style sheets
- Supports mouse wheel and keypress (soon) events
- Supports PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2 and PySide6
